# Hello!
I'm Mariano Guti√©rrez from Argentina and this is my final project for CS50.

**'La cuisine de Mariano'** is simple wab application where users can create their accounts,
search through a large variety of meals and save recipes into 'Favorites'.

It's very intuitive. First you'll have to Register and the Log in. At the index you'll see some random recipes 
that will change everytime this page is reached or refreshed.

At the navigation bar you will see 'Search' and 'Favorites'. 
Click on the first if you want to look up for meals by category or by key word.
Click on 'Favorites' and you will see all meals you add as favorites.

Also users can change their password by clicking on 'Change password'

That's it! Hope you enjoy it and cook something nice!
